Neo : &quot;I know Kung Fu&quot;.

<p>

This line from the Matrix came to mind when I finished
this finger-thick book from O'Reilly.
<p>
Having waded through plenty of vendor-centric whitepapers and marketing
documents on SANs and NAS, I still had plenty of questions itching
to be scratched. This book did a great deal to tackle them.
<p>
Rather than profile the target reader by job title or function, the author 
sets out questions he wants to provide answers for. Paraphrasing, they
were;<br>
&quot;what are SANs/NAS&quot;,<br>
&quot;what is the difference between SANs/NAS&quot;,<br>
&quot;which is right for me&quot;,<br>
&quot;what will a SAN/NAS solution allow me to do&quot;,<br>
&quot;what tasks will I face dealing with SANs/NAS&quot;.
<p>
The clarity and honesty with which Preston deals with these questions
is refreshing and highly informative.
<p>
Besides citing pros and cons for various SAN and NAS storage,
backup and recovery solutions, the author provides historical
background to help the reader understand where these solutions
are coming from and what problems they were trying to solve.
<p>
None of the historical content (which includes sections on SCSI/SAN,
NFS/CIFS/NAS and NDMP development) is so lengthy as to be a diversion
from the main drive of the text.
<p>
The chapters on backup and recovery for both SAN and NAS do an
excellent job of cleanly presenting the various clueful solutions
(LAN-free, server-free, client-free, snapshots, mirrors, NDMP, etc)
available to admins. I also commend the author for a well
reasoned clarification of the potentially confusing
&quot;client/server-free&quot; terminology used in this area.
<p>
Amidst the generic explanations of storage challenges and solutions,
the author briefly cites real-world examples of various vendor
solutions, and does so without touting the virtues of any
particular player in the market.
<p>
There is very little in the way of errata listed on the O'Reilly
site for this edition, mostly minor typos which should do
nothing to mislead the reader.
<p>
<b>Summary</b>
<p>
This is an excellent book for those with fundamental questions
on SANs and NAS, but also provides sufficient depth for the
reader to appreciate usage pros and cons in various scenarious.
<p>
I highly recommend this book.
