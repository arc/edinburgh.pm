<p>

Part I deals with the C programming language. Technically I found the
authors' writing to be well measured, striking a good balance between
succinctness and depth. This was accomplished while avoiding dryness in
what was a sensibly structured text.

<p>

However on page 136 in the section on "Pointers to Functions", I came across
something which tainted the rest of the book for me. The example code used
(example 9.5) bore a striking resemblance to example code used in a well-known
online treatment of the same topic, by Lars Haendel. Search for
"C function pointer" if you don't already know the name.

<p>

I found the legalese at the front of the book regarding use of code examples
and the requirement for the work to be attributed to the authors, with
copyright assigned to O'Reilly. I also found the author's acknowledgements
and thanks sections, with no mention of Haendel.

<p>

Now, it may well be that the authors came up with their code example for
"Pointers to Functions" on their own and that it is just sheer
coincidence that they chose to use the exact same set of fuctions to illustrate
callbacks - or it may be that they determined that they did not have to
acknowledge Haendel, for whatever reason.

<p>

However, given that the copyright of Haendel's example predates the book
under review, it seems likely to me that the authors' example was at least
inspired by Haendel's text. And so, from then onwards, I continually wondered
just how much of these code examples, copyright of O'Reilly, were inspired
by or taken from some unacknowledged source.

<p>

The authors didn't write the C programming language, so they're already
standing on the shoulders of giants. But I would expect any author writing
about a programming language they didn't create to sing good and hard for
their supper and at the very least put the effort into developing their own
code examples.

<p>

Leaving that hiccup aside, part II is a good reference for the standard
library, clearly marking those functions added in C99 while offering
many small examples of usage throughout. Following two short chapters
outlining the header files and functions grouped by areas of application,
the beefier library reference is offered up in alphabetic order, with about
2 functions being fitted in per page.

<p>

Accounting for over 40% of the page count, this part felt like the real meat
and two veg' of the book and I expect this section will receive the most
regular thumbing by owners.

<p>

I would have been happy to see the credits roll at this point. However, the
authors had bolted on 3 chapters dealing with some big hitters from the GNU
tools stable; gcc, make and gdb.

<p>

My first reaction was that this was surplus to requirement and was less
than impressed to see early gcc content explaining how to obtain gcc, followed
by a step-by-step handholding of how C code becomes an executable. Similar
baby steps were taken in the gdb chapter when the authors felt the need to
define for the reader what a debugger is.

<p>

The authors state their goal for the book to be "a convenient, reliable
companion for C programmers in their day-to-day work.". They also state that
the text is "not an introduction to programming in C".

<p>

I found the (albeit) short treament of fundamentals in the gcc and gdb content
hard to reconcile with the above statements. However, I saw these three
chapters as reasonable introductory fodder for those who may be new
to the language or to GNU tools.

<p>

Those either using different tool chains, or with experience in the
covered tools, are unlikely to do more than fan past these pages on
the way to the index. For that reason I can't help but think that these pages
are either already a waste, or shortly will be as the reader outgrows the
relatively potted coverage afforded.


<p>

<b>Summary</b>

<p>

Maybe I've grown sentimentally attached to my K&amp;R, but as good as the
writing is, there was little in part I to make me consider retiring the older,
original work.

<p>

As for part III, did it add value? I don't believe it did and I can't
stand dead weight in dead wood. "No wasted words here!" the back cover boasts.
I disagree.

<p>

The authors want this to be "..the book every C programmer will want nearby
when writing code". Did it deliver? I'd have to say, 'maybe'. Let me qualify
that.

<p>

First off, I don't believe anyone is going to be swayed into buying this
book for the three GNU tools chapters. So it all boils down to what you
already have for language and standard library reference.

<p>

Got K&amp;R? Happy with standards docs or some other C99-grade standard C
library reference? Then I don't see this being worth your money.

<p>

However, if you already have K&amp;R, and you don't already have a
decent C99-grade standard C library reference, then I'd say part II is
probably worth the price of admission.

<p>

And, finally, if you don't already have any C language/library reference
text while going about your "day-to-day work", then this book is a great
place to start.
