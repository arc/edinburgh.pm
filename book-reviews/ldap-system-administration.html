NewUser: "How do I change my password?"
<p>
LocalAdmin: "Ok, you've got to change it here, then login to admin01 and run
'ourpasswordchange' to change it."
<p>
It's a familiar conversation that I'm sure we've all had in a new workplace,
educational facility etc. Passwords and user account info stored on multiple
systems. I always used to think 'They should use LDAP' but along with that
thought was the nagging knowledge that I didn't really know much about LDAP,
thankfully LDAP System Administration comes to the rescue.
<p>
The book is split into two parts. The first part deals with LDAP itself. We
begin with a gentle introduction to directory systems and LDAP, before moving
swiftly onto a more technical discussion. I was pleased to see that during these
introductory chapters (and throughout the rest of the book) the author makes
many mentions to the RFCs on which LDAP is based. Personally I like to see this
as I know I can go and check the exact wordings of those texts, without spending
an age prodding and poking a search engine to find the RFC I need.
<p>
The author uses OpenLDAP as a directory server to build your directory in and
you are encouraged to build up a sample directory as you work through the book.
The remaining sections in part one deal with the server setup and you then work
through making your own directory. Each section moves at a nice pace with the
author touching on some further issues (e.g. kerberos authentication) and then
pointing you in the direction of the resources so you can study those issues
further.
<p>
The second section of the book mainly deals with integrating your new directory
server with your applications. Here the book shows it's age slightly with
mentions of older mail clients, however I found the theories to be sound. In my
opinion this section really shows off the power of LDAP. You are given good
examples of how and where your new directory can be put to use, and these
examples are backed with a reasoning. The overall theme to this section, and
indeed the book, is making your life as an admin easier.
<p>
The chapters I found most interesting were those on moving from NIS to LDAP, and
a section on making your directory servers play nicely with other vendors
implementations (OpenLDAP and ActiveDirectory show that they can be happy
together). The book rounds off with a chapter on Net::LDAP, with some small
example scripts to show you how you can manage your directory.
<p>
<b>Summary</b>
<p>
Overall I enjoyed this book, I found it to be an easy read with each section
clearly explained. LDAP turned out to be a much more powerful tool than I had
imagined and its something I'd defiantly try to use when starting any new
company or IT venture.  For me the nagging feeling is now gone and I'd happily
recommend the book to anyone who is wanting to get started with LDAP.
