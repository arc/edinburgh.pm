    <p>&quot;Beyond the Basics of Learning Perl&quot;, advertises the front cover, and
    those aren't just empty words.  The <em>Learning Perl</em> in this case
    is the book originally written by noted Perl trainer Randal L. Schwartz
    and now in its fourth edition.  <em>Learning Perl</em> is certainly
    popular, but since it's intended to be an introductory text, there are a
    number of important Perl topics that it doesn't cover.  Among them are
    objects, references, and modules, all of which are important for writing
    larger Perl programs (and many smaller Perl programs too).</p>

    <p>That's where this book comes in.  Randal (and his coauthor and
    colleague Tom Phoenix) base the book on the materials they successfully
    use in their Perl training courses, just as they did with <em>Learning
    Perl</em>.  The goal is clear: to make sure that concepts are presented
    in a way refined by the experience of teaching them to real
    students.</p>

    <p>This raises an important point.  There seems to be a widespread
    perception that references in particular are very hard to learn in Perl
    - possibly encouraged by the fact that <em>Learning Perl</em> avoids
    covering them.  But that perception doesn't fit with my own experiences,
    either as a learner or as a Perl trainer.  The most widespread problem
    I've seen among students is dealing with the sheer quantity of material
    to learn, especially when it comes to the syntaxes for using references.
    But as long as references are taught in a sensible way, and without
    presenting too much information too soon, I've found that students can
    readily pick up the material.</p>

    <p>I'm glad to report, therefore, that <em>Learning Perl Objects,
    References, and Modules</em> covers references in a way which strikes me
    as entirely suitable for learners.  Chapter 3 &quot;Introduction to
    References&quot; begins with a single type of reference: array references.
    It successfully motivates them by demonstrating a problem they solve:
    writing a subroutine which modifies an array provided by the caller.
    The relevant syntax is introduced gradually, but all the necessary
    syntax is covered by the end of the chapter.  The chapter ends with a
    brief introduction of hash references.</p>

    <p>Chapter 4 &quot;References and Scoping&quot; continues, describing carefully
    what happens when multiple references point to the same thingy, and the
    orthogonality of references and variable scoping.  Chapter 5
    &quot;Manipulating Complex Data Structures&quot; contains lots of useful
    information and examples for dealing with nested data structures,
    including the use of <code>Data::Dumper</code>.  Chapter 6 &quot;Subroutine
    References&quot; covers subroutine references and closures in reasonable
    depth, describing dispatch tables and callbacks as common uses of them.
    Chapter 7 &quot;Practical Reference Tricks&quot; is a grab-bag of well-known
    techniques using references, including sorting and recursive data
    structures; it's particularly useful for beginners who may not have seen
    such techniques in other languages.  All told, these four chapters
    provide a comprehensive yet readily comprehensible grounding in the
    non-object uses of references in Perl.</p>

    <p>Chapter 8 therefore offers a introduction to object-oriented
    programming (OO), and to the use of OO techniques in Perl.  Unusually,
    this first chapter on OO focuses on class methods to the exclusion of
    object instances.  While this approach seems strange at first, it does
    make sense: students can concentrate on the concepts of methods and
    inheritance without having to simultaneously deal with instances, or
    with reference syntax (which is presumably still relatively fresh in
    their minds at this stage). Chapter 9 &quot;Objects with Data&quot; introduces
    object instances, along with instance methods, instance data, and
    accessors. Chapter 10 &quot;Object Destruction&quot; has all the necessary
    information on destructors, including the use of weak references to deal
    with sets of objects that circularly refer to each other.  Chapter 11
    &quot;Some Advanced Object Topics&quot; concludes the OO discussion with an
    introduction to topics like <code>UNIVERSAL</code>,
    <code>AUTOLOAD</code>, and multiple inheritance.  There's clearly much
    more that could be said about OO in Perl - Damien Conway has an entire
    book on the subject - but beginners are given a very good foundation in
    both the mechanics and the idioms.</p>

    <p>All this isn't to say that the book is perfect, however.  The
    practical exercises at the end of each chapter are fine as far as they
    go, but I suspect many students would welcome additional exercises.
    Also, a large number of the code examples and exercises refer to
    characters from the 1960s US television sitcom <em>Gilligan's
    Island</em>.  It's definitely useful for students to read examples that
    are in some way meaningful, compared to yet another
    <code>foobar</code>-ridden sample.  But there's always a risk that
    picking a single topic like this can cause problems for those who aren't
    familiar with it; certainly I found the subject of these examples
    slightly confusing.</p>

    <p>I'd also question the relative levels of coverage for some of the
    topics other than references and modules.  It's very encouraging to see
    a chapter in a beginner's text that introduces automated testing; but
    arguably this should be extended at the expense of the material on
    preparing module distributions and submitting modules to CPAN.  More
    importantly, it strikes me as particularly strange that <code>use</code>
    is covered so lightly and so late in the book (chapter 12).  Chapter 2
    describes how <code>require</code> can load modules, including the use
    of packages as namespaces, but doesn't go so far as to describe
    importing library functions into another namespace.  I'd like to see
    much better coverage of how to create function libraries - and
    especially of how to use them, given the importance of CPAN as a
    repository of reusable code.</p>

<b>Summary</b>

    <p>A few relatively minor quibbles aside, this seems like an excellent
    introduction to the use of references and object-oriented programming in
    Perl.  A little more focus on using and creating libraries of functions
    would be helpful, but all the necessary information is there.</p>
