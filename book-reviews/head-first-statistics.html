<p>
This is a very readable study book for new university students (or
people around that stage) learning statistics and probability for an
academic course. It goes to great lengths to be fun and memorable to
read for people who probably have a lot of books to get through, and who
may find the topic difficult.  It uses clip art and photography
extensively, as well as breaking up the routine of the text with
different styles of content, and lots of exercises. A typical page has a
simple graph or algebraic equation with "hand written" annotations
emphasising key characteristics, then a photograph of a student (to whom
the reader can relate) making some comment, and a few paragraphs of
text. It adds up to something covering many pages, but which is easier
to digest.
<p>
The publishers make a big deal of the "Head First" style, beginning with
a whole chapter about it. The repetition works quite well although I
sometimes think that I'd rather cram something new in to my fading
grey-cells than hear the same story again. My favourite part of the
technique was the brief annotations on pictures and in the observations
by the photographed people. They often summarised a tricky point very
clearly and concisely. Making a formula talk about itself and who it is
similar to, is surprisingly good. Sometimes the repetition got the
better of me, for example on pages 416, 417 and 418 where a point that
was merely about an example was made 4 times.
<p>
There are lots of really well designed examples. They are based on
plausible scenarios such as a gym that wants to allocate new members to
the class with the closest average age, but keeps getting into a muddle
because they do their statistics wrongly. In one, a 17 year old man
joined a class where the median age was exactly 17, only to find out
that it was a mother-and-toddler swimming class and he was not welcome!
The exercises build on these examples. Although I found them generally
easy, I think that they would be well balanced for a person meeting
these topics for the first time.
<p>
For myself, I was looking for a reminder about which statistical
techniques can be applied to different types of experimental data, but I
did not find that; the pinnacle of the book's coverage seemed to be the
normal distribution. I was nevertheless pleased to find a page about
sources of bias in badly chosen sample sets. Its main topics go from
plotting simple data to averages and variance, an introduction to
probabilities, the binomial, geometric and poisson distributions, the
normal distribution, sampling and making predictions about the larger
population, hypothesis tests, then finally the chi-squared test and
correlation lines.
<p>
There were some over-simplifications, such as that time should always go
on the X axis of a line chart, whereas I'd expect to see the controlled
variable which isn't necessarily time. Some charts had compressed areas
representing large gaps in the data set which is a trick to be used
sparingly, and actually worked against the topic at hand. I found a few
mistakes, such as a graph axis on p38 labelled "Hours" which should be
"Age", and a data set on p61 miscopied from p55. The print quality is
not as good as books on artistic topics; most of the photographs are too
dark.
<p>
In summary, Head First Statistics covers its topic very clearly, and is
an excellent study aid for basic probability and statistics. It looks
very different from the average book, and almost all of those
innovations work really well, especially the one-sentence annotations.
The examples and exercises are strong, and the book progresses well
through advancing topics.
