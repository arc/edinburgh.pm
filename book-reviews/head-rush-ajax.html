Overall:
<p>
A good book to start to get the whole Ajax "phenomenon" into your
head, get it there fast and make it stick. It expects you to know
some basics which anyone who has dabbled semi-seriously with web
development will already know.
<p>
The style of the book is very good with constant repetition of the key
areas, facts and methodologies to get them to stick in your
brain. Added to this different methods of presenting the same
information are used which helps even more.
<p>
The examples are well paced throughout and each builds to some extent
on the previous ones helping to fix the concepts in your brain.
<p>
In covering all of the key areas of the whole Ajax issue, namely:
asynchronous requests, DOM, XML and server side programming, it is a
great entry into the whole shooting match.
<p>
Detailed:
<p>
The placement and content of the mini-FAQs throughout the book is very
well done - they are close enough to the subject matter to ensure they
are about the stuff just been discussed.
<p>
It is good to see a book about web development mention that there are
differences between the major browsers available. I would have
preferred to have seen FireFox used as the main development browser as
I think it is more wide spread than Safari. That aside the focus on
using the standards to achieve a working site is good to see to
flatten out these differences.
<p>
While the book's main goal is to teach you Ajax it is pleasing to see
that it makes a clear distinction between the DOM, XML and the
asynchronous parts of the whole thing - great. I think that it skated
over the XML side maybe a bit too quickly - moving onto discussing
JSON very quickly - but then XML is such a huge area that it makes no
sense to go into too much detail. While it did not dissect the DOM in
its fullness it presented a reasonably detailed picture of it to let
people get started with it all.
<p>
Being a professional C developer some of the code examples left me
shaking my head a bit with "you wouldn't do it like that" - but they
served their purpose: to show how to write JavaScript to access the
Ajax/DOM features not to show you how to write JavaScript.
<p>
I found the extra section on SQL injection attack very interesting and
would have liked to have seen more examples of real world data attacks
- though again that would be more for a professional web developer
book than a head cram starter.
<p>
It did totally leave out any in-depth discussion of the HTTP header
values that can be manipulated by the XMLHttpRequest object or even
mentioning them. Again, I suppose this is in keeping with its
positioning as an entry level publication.
<p>
Errors:
<p>
Page 9: next to the block of questions it states "Answers on page 9"
they are in fact on page 63.
