<p>
I have not read the first two books on the series (Learning Perl and
Intermediate Perl) both of which are mentioned a few times in Mastering Perl,
so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but I can only assume they have a
similar structure.  The content of Mastering Perl is not unlike a cookbook,
however rather that showing you individual recipes, it takes an ingredient
and shows you numerous things you can do with it.
<p>
Each chapter starts with an introduction on the simple concept of the
subject matter, then builds on these giving (usually) multiple
approaches/solutions plus a good indication as to what the author's own
favourite is.  Each section contains enough code examples to reinforce the
theory, but keeps them brief enough not to detract from the overall flow.
<p>
The exception to this was the chapter on 'Advanced Regular Expressions' which
I found a little tricky to get through, although it would challenge the
greatest of authors to write a chapter on this topic with complete finesse.
However it does appear at the start of the book so it would be a shame if
it managed to put a reader off the rest of the book.
<p>
The chapters which were particularly interesting to me were:
<ul>
<li>Profiling Perl : This goes from simple methods for simple benchmarks to
writing your own profiler, while in between lies a very useful section on
DBI profiling.
<li>Symbol Tables and Typeglobs : Used as a grounding for many of the concepts
discussed in later chapters, this is very much in the category of things you
do not really need to know, but that once you do a lot of Perl internals
become clearer.
<li>Dynamic Subroutines :  Following on from the chapter on Symbol Tables
this chapter will have you treating your functions like they were standard
variables without a second thought.
<li>The Magic of Tied Variables : If you are like me and have never really
used tied variables, this section will have you itching to try them out.
</ul>

These, and each of the other chapters, contained enough useful tips and
information to ensure that I'll keep this book to hand whenever I embark
on a new Perl project.   The author's obvious knowledge and enthusiasm for
the language certainly shines through to the point where he has to rein
himself back and warn against some of the less standard tricks he has for
Perl that are not always recommended practices.
<p>
<b>Summary</b>
<p>
I don't think, nor would I expect from a 'Mastering' title, that this book
contains essential information for a Perl programmer. But it does contain
a lot of tricks which, as well as being useful in their own right,  go a
long way to explain both the inner workings of Perl and the construction
of many core modules. So if you want to know what goes on behind the scenes
when you 'use constant => foo' or how the Exporter module works, this is the
book for you.
