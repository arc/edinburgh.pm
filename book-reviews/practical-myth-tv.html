<p>
MythTV is a wonderful tool when it works, with a rich set of features and
abilities.  Like any other good PVR, it does a great job at recording the
programmes you like and letting you watch them when you want.  As often as
you want.  Where you want.  Even for non couch potatoes, it really does
improve life.
<p>
With the current stable release (v0.20) it beats most of the established
(commercial, closed) competition for features.  The recordings are mpg
files, easy to access, copy, transcode, burn to DVD or play on another
device.  Commercial skipping, while not perfect, really is a big win and
well worth having (and you notice it a lot more when you use something
other than MythTV).  You can add multiple tuners to record multiple channels
simultaneously (you will most likely max out your harddisk i/o before you
hit cpu or usb bus bandwidth limits).  Multiple MythTV devices can simply
be networked together, allowing playback in multiple locations and even
sharing the workload between themselves to allow even more simultaneous
recording.  MythWeb lets you control and access everything via a browser.
There is even a plugin that allows you to use your MythTV box as SIP VoIP
phone.  I have no idea why you would want to though.
<p>
That is what I can do now.  The potential is mouth watering.  It is
possible, although not easy, to integrate with content you have (legally)
downloaded.  Have it be your music center.  Stream your video over an ADSL
or broadband connection to where ever you are in the world.  It doesn't
produce amazing quality but that is entirely the fault of limited upload
bandwidth on adsl.  When someone gets around to integrating (in a Steve
Jobs style) lots of MythTV boxes with a social 2.0 website or a bittorrent
tracker, things could go a little ballistic.  All this is possible now if
you know what you are doing and are prepared to fiddle.  A lot.
<p>
But nirvana is not without its problems.  MythTV is mind bogglingly
(and unnecessarily imho) complicated to get setup and understand and
amazingly easy to screw up and get wrong.  It makes configuring and
compiling your own linux kernel look positively easy.
<p>
For instance, the compulsory X11 based setup program, which throws away
all the wisdom of established desktop UIs and opts to re-engineer and
re-implement a complex and confusing alternative to a simple text based
configuration file.  Nor does all this complexity achieve the sort of
setup almost any other traditional tv equipment manages - turn it on, run
auto-tune, watch tv.
<p>
And so, the book.
<p>
It covers all the important parts, and it gives as much detail as could
reasonably be squeezed into a tech sized volume.  It is clearly written,
well layed out.
<p>
A lot of the information you will be able to find on the MythTV wiki, or
so long as your Google-fu has not gone brain dead from watching too much TV.
On the plus side, it is a lot easier to read when collected together and
presented in order.  The downside is that the book is going to date
quickly and cannot hope to cover every possible configurable variation.
<p>
Even so, the book had more than a few nuggets of gold I had not learned
after extensive web research.
<p>
If you play with MythTV this book is going to be useful.  Sadly, it is
not going to make the process painless.
