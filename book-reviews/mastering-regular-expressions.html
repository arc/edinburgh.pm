<p>
<em>Mastering Regular Expressions</em> has been around for a long
time &#8212; this is the third edition of a book originally published a decade
ago.  Does that actually reflect justified popularity, or is it just
that this is the only book-length treatment of the various regex
engines, how they differ, and how to get the most out of them?  I'm glad
to say that doesn't seem to be case: if you use regexes in any depth at
all, you should probably read this book.</p>

<p>The tight integration of regular expressions into the rest of the
language is one of the defining characteristics of Perl.  It also tends
to inform idiomatic Perl code: a lot of Perl code can (and does) make
full use of all the facilities of the regex engine.  But many
programmers treat advanced use of regexes as a bit of a black art,
relying perhaps on cargo-culting as a problem-solving approach (or even
the ever-popular technique of editing randomly till it seems to
work).</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that tutorial-style books typically don't have
enough space to do full justice to the capabilities of regexes, while
reference texts typically cover the details of each feature, without
analysing what you can actually accomplish with them.  This is precisely
the gap that <em>Mastering Regular Expressions</em> attempts to fill,
offering full, in-depth coverage of everything you need to know to get
the most out of your regexes.</p>

<p>The two opening chapters are aimed mainly at novices, though they can
also be good review material for more experienced readers seeking to
clarify or confirm their understanding.  Chapter&#160;1 starts by looking at
what sorts of things regexes can do, and the syntaxes used; it
introduces a useful mental model for thinking about regexes.  Friedl
looks at a real-world example &#8212; finding doubled words &#8212; right from the
start, which is very encouraging.  Chapter&#160;2 continues in the same vein,
applying regexes to additional realistic tasks.  It also begins to look
at how to write regex-using code in various programming languages.</p>

<p>Chapter&#160;3 deals with the nitty-gritty details of the various regex
dialects: which features are available in which engines, and the
cross-engine syntactic differences for the features that they all share.
This is definitely useful even for more-experienced readers, especially
those who are mostly familiar with one dialect (say, Perl) but
occasionally need to use another (perhaps that of the traditional Unix
<code>grep</code>(1) utility).</p>

<p>Chapter&#160;4 is perhaps the core of the book in terms of detailed
descriptions of how regex engines work.  It offers a typology of regex
engines (DFA, Traditional NFA, POSIX NFA, or hybrid), looking in detail
at how the choice of implementation affects the way your regex is
executed.  This involves some discussion of the theory behind regexes,
but the approach is overwhelmingly practical and pragmatic rather than
mathematical.  (Indeed, <a href="http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html">some authors</a>
suggest that, if anything, Friedl pays too little attention to the
underlying theory.)</p>

<p>Chapter&#160;5 takes the knowledge built up in the previous chapter and
applies it to a larger variety of real-world problems &#8212; and without
avoiding thorny issues that often crop up in practice.  Chapter&#160;6 is in
much the same vein, but focuses especially on performance: the
optimisations that engines apply automatically, and how to craft regexes
to take maximum advantage of the way the engine works.</p>

<p>The remaining chapters are rather different: each covers a particular
programming language, and the regex facilities offered in that language.
Chapter&#160;7 looks at Perl, and is the most detailed; that's not entirely
surprising given Perl's tight integration of regexes.  The remaining
chapters cover Java, .NET, and PHP respectively.</p>

<p>There's much to like about <em>Mastering Regular Expressions</em>.
It's certainly a comprehensive analysis of how to get the most out of
regexes, especially for Perl programmers.  It demonstrates enormous
attention to detail; for example, it adopts some simple but clever
typographical conventions that eliminate confusion between text that is
matched by a regex on the one hand, and the textual representation of
the regex itself on the other.</p>

<p>That said, it's not impossible to find things to complain about.  At
times, it explains things with metaphors that are somewhat too cutesy
for my taste (though I can imagine some readers finding them very
helpful).  A case could also be made that, for a reader whose interest
is focussed on any given regex implementation, there's too much coverage
of all the others; in particular, Friedl's preference for Perl is
obvious.  But then, the results are better than having separate books
for each major tool, and it can be of interest to look at the different
features available in other worlds.</p>

<p>Another potential issue for some is that, for obvious and unavoidable
chronological reasons, this edition can't cover the new regex features
available in the forthcoming release of Perl&#160;5.10 &#8212; or, for that matter,
the rather different pattern-matching language that will be part of
Perl&#160;6.  It would be pleasing for future editions will cover these
changes.</p>

<p>Overall, <em>Mastering Regular Expressions</em> is an excellent book.
I highly recommend it to all intermediate or advanced Perl programmers,
or anyone else who often needs to extract information out of text.</p>
