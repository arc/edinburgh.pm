<p>

Larry initially created Perl to ease systems data munging-related woes, so
this book could be viewed as the use of the language in its birthplace.
Any expectations of wizardry conjoured by this inceptive combination
are soon dispelled.

<p>

What is presented here is a useful but thin patchwork of sys admin tasks,
with just enough code, hints and references to point the reader in a reasonable
direction to get the job done. To that extent, the book can be said to
deliver on its stated desire to make you more productive.

<p>

The publisher is hoping to market to all levels of admins and I understand
the need to cater to beginners and to provide context for the code and
tactics offered. However, given the volume of exposition of various
systems-related technologies and protocols, I would suggest that the
target readership be more realistically aimed at defacto or inexperienced
sys admins.

<p>

Quite often the solutions boiled down to 'run a system command from perl,
then capture and munge its output'. Which may well be the appropriate solution,
but in such cases I increasingly found myself thinking "is that it!?".

<p>

That said, there is sufficient cross-platform coverage here to ease the
gotchas of the otherwise experienced admin facing simple tasks in an
unfamiliar environment. While this aspect is not heavily promoted, I feel
it is where the real shelf-life value lies in this text.

<p>

Finally, I may have been overly hungry for some entertainment following
what was an unsatisfying read, but the real world tale of Perl being used
in an emergency to glue an investigative tool together failed to deliver
any real sense of drama or humour, which may have resulted in a more
memorable lesson.

<p>

<b>Summary</b>

<p>

If you don't know much about the tools or technologies relevant to systems
administration then this book will likely deliver a reasonable grounding in
many of them. Otherwise there is little here to impress and you will
probably be better served by CPAN and other online sources.
