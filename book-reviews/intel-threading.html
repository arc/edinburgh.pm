<b>Synopsis:</b>
<p>
Not for the neophyte. The material being covered was done in a manner
that assumed a familiarity with underlying concepts. There were some
useful pieces of information within the text but there were also some
inaccuracies as well.
<p>
<b>Detail:</b>
<p>
Some of the information given seems to be technically incorrect or
misleading. For instance the section "What Is A Thread" in Chapter 2
is not strictly correct when applied to Linux; this system does not
have threads in the scheme presented. There is a paragraph that
starts:
<p>
 "Therefore, all modern operating systems support the subdivision of
 processes into multiple threads of execution."
<p>
As a number Linux distributions still have no native thread concept
but utilise lightweight processes this is a sweeping and technically
incorrect statement. Yes threading packages do exist but they are by
no means used exclusively.
<p>
The next area of information that glosses over some very technical
information is the one that deals with cache aligned memory allocation
in Chapter 6. The organisation of processor caches is highly
architecture specific, so to include the following "The padding is
typically 128 bytes" without reference to any silicon architectural
implementation could be construed as dangerous. If information relating
to lower levels of the hardware are to be given then they should be
done so with very specific and concrete examples.
<p>
The reproduction of the class definitions within the text of the
publication does not seem 100% relevant as should someone have this
book they should also have the help files for the library to hand. Or,
failing that, the actual header files themselves. The inclusion of one
or two function signatures to show how to override them is a useful
feature, as was done when illustrating what standard memory allocation
routines to replace.
<p>
The examples covered a good range of how to apply the building blocks
to a number of familiar problems. In fact it may have been far better
had the book been structured to have more examples at the point of the
introduction of a new concept or programming structure to fix it in
the mind of the reader.
<p>
I realise that the book is "Intel Threading Building Blocks" and so a
certain number of the points mentioned should have been implicit,
e.g. processor architecture. However, I think that as the book raised
these issues it should have been very careful to define its frame of
reference.
<p>
Overall, while the book contained useful information I did not feel it
covered enough outwith what is publicly available or with the building
block library to make it useful in the medium to long term.
