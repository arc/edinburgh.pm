<p>
This book is a treasure. Not only does it explain Agile Development
clearly and entertainingly, but it is thoroughly grounded in how it pans
out in real organisations. It also covers several business and software
engineering issues which I didn't expect, such as unit testing
techniques and process improvement.
<p>
It is aimed at people who want to start using Extreme Programming on
their software development projects. It seems that XP is almost, but not
quite, synonymous with Agile Development. For each of its principles, we
learn the concept, what the outcome should be, how it might go wrong,
and where to read more. Sometimes there is a short FAQ section. If your
existing organisation can't incorporate this principle; sometimes you
can make up for it in other ways, or sometimes you can follow the
principle while still satisfying your bosses.
<p>
The book starts with the thoughtful principles of XP, such as pair
programming (continuous review and better design through discussion),
energised work (sleep well, be motivated, and focus when in the
office),  an informative workspace (sharing progress with the team),
root cause analysis (ask "why" 5 times, to get to a more substantial
answer), retrospectives. The book goes on to collaborating: sit
together, real customer involvement, and more. The next part is
releasing: continuous integration, weekly iterations, all the follow-on
tasks like integration done. Planning  includes product vision, release
planning, iterations (development cycles), risk, stories (tasks), and
estimating. Finally, the principles of development include incremental
requirements, test-driven development, refactoring, and simplicity.
<p>
The book is designed either to be dipped into, having cross references
and a target audience for each section, or to be read cover to cover.
It's really all about how to apply Agile Development within a real
project. What should you do if some people don't want to join in? How
large or small can a team be? What information do you share with
stakeholders outside the team itself? Can you manage without a
particular principle?
<p>
Despite having started with a tone that didn't capture my enthusiasm
immediately, the body of the book is engagingly and genuinely plausible.
The authors have worked in real companies on real projects, and know how
to get Agile to work. Personally however, I tend to feel that Agile
development works better with trustworthy, skilled and flexible staff,
than with "entry-level" skills. If people don't have the confidence to
go from designing to testing to developing to releasing all within the
same day, then I think they may find this more challenging than working
to a specification.
<p>
One of the ideas new to me is the "retrospective". This is a regular
meeting, perhaps once after each iteration which should ideally be
weekly. The team discusses what went well, and what didn't, then chooses
a single topic to improve for the next time. This bright approach to
process improvement is in contrast to the procedures, audits and
cheeseburger outcomes of some quality management philosophies. The book
also explores testing in more detail.
<p>
The final section explores ways to improve your results with XP even
beyond the textbook methods. Many of the ideas are hinted at throughout
the main text,  so this might be seen as a kind of conclusion to wrap up
the volume.
<p>
The whole book is a pleasure to read. Without being jokey, it is fun and
informative. It is well printed and laid out with extensive cross
references and some summary boxes or quotations. The references to other
books make it very well linked within its area of software engineering.
Without doubt, the greatest strength of this book is the integrity and
experience that shines through the wise responses to real world
challenges posed by traditional organisations.
