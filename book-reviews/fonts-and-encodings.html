Fonts are the clothes that words wear and Encodings turn bytes into meaning.
<i>Fonts &amp; Encodings</i> landed on my desk rather surprising me by its
size. At over 1,000 pages it's a comparable size to the last big 'fonty' tome
I'd read from O'Reilly: <i>CJKV Information Processing</i>.
<p>
Initially I thought they'd sent me the wrong book: the colour scheme had turned
from 'Web Design' blue into 'Text Processing' magenta somewhere between the
picture in the catalogue and the first printing. A quick bit of googling turned
up this explanation of
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/oreilly/blog/2006/09/the_mystery_behind_our_spine_c.html">
O'Reilly's spine colour logic</a>.
<p>
The book is broken down into four sections and seven appendixes. The appendixes
are unusually large taking up well over a third of the book.
<p>
The first part takes us through encodings, starting with early encodings such as
FIELDATA (no, I'd never heard of it either) then moving onto ASCII, EBCDIC, ISO
2022, 8859, Microsoft code pages and so on. It then moves onto a detailed look
at Unicode, character properties and bidirectionality.
<p>
Part two covers font management on Mac OS, Windows and X Windows. As you may
expect Mac OS is spoilt for choice. Windows comes out looking like a poor
cousin. Both of them look like a doddle in comparison to the X Windows
situation.
<p>
Part three takes us into TeX territory. We're introduced to &Omega;, an
extension to TeX allowing use of Unicode, which the author co-developed.
<p>
Part four moves onto font classification and takes a look at the different
methods available for classifying fonts. Here I was rubbing my eyes in
disbelief in finding an <i>actual description</i> of PANOSE.
<p>
The appendixes add some very useful material, discussing bitmap fonts and the
variety of different font formats in great detail. Finally it has a nice section
describing B&eacute;zier curves.
<p>
While reading I noticed a number of errors. Most were minor. This first edition
of the book was translated from Haralambous' French version, by P. Scott Horne,
so I reckoned occasional errors were forgiveable. Initially these were of the
spelling mistake variety but later on an occasional fact wouldn't ring true:
does PostScript <i>really</i> use a 1,024-unit em square? I thought it was
1,000.
<p>
<b>Summary</b>
<p>
Leafing through the pages I find myself thinking that it's such a shame I
didn't have this book all those years ago when we started writing my company's
font engine.
<p>
It's a very dense book, but doesn't feel like it. The clear and meaningful
descriptions of concepts and the amount of detail is excellent. I can't think of
anything that could be added and, equally important, anything that should be
taken away.
<p>
Well worth diving into if you're in any way involved in using fonts.
