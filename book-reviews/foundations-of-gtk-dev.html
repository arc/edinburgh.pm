When a developer begins the design process for a new open source GUI
application, there are only two viable choices, Trolltech's Qt and GTK+.
GUI applications are complicated to write and often complicated to
understand.  Into this space steps, Apress' "Foundations of GTK+ Development"
by Andrew Krause, the developer of OpenLDev IDE built with GTK+ 2.  From the
first page, the reader is impressed with the scope and depth of the topics
covered.  Krause takes the reader from the first Hello World program to
creating custom widgets in thirteen chapters.  The layout of the page is
clean and the code sections are clearly typeset with good variable names
and structure making the intent of the code clear.
<p>
While the main purpose of the book is to provide a reference for the
experienced GTK+ developer, the layout of the chapters emphasizes teaching
the beginner the basic structures of a GTK+ program all the way to advanced
topics such as developing custom widgets and the Glade GUI builder
application.  Many of the most important details, such as various
enumerations, are placed appropriately in the appendices while those that
are used are clearly detailed in the text.
<p>
As Krause focuses on the foundation of GTK+ development, all the examples
are in C and the reader should be prepared with a good knowledge of C.
While there are many different languages which have bindings for GTK+, which
allow programmers to use their programming language of choice, the advantage
of learning the C foundations of GTK+ is that the reader gets a clear
understanding of how the library works "under the hood". The reader will
appreciate how their chosen bindings interact with the base library.
<p>
Each chapter begins with a list of what a reader will learn and ends with
a summary of the major points of the chapter followed by an exercise.
These exercises are designed to be broad and leave much for the reader
to do and learn with in the structure given by the exercise.  If the
reader becomes stuck the website
(<a href="http://www.gtkbook.com">http://www.gtkbook.com</a>) has the
appropriate sources to help the reader understand the structure being
used within the program to achieve its ends.
<p>
Chapter 1 gives the history of the GTK+ project, X11, covers the
installation of the details of the libraries involved in developing
GTK+ applications.  The exercise at the end of Chapter 1 has the reader
verify the installation of the GTK+ libraries.
<p>
Chapter 2 is where the rubber hits the road as far as programming with
GTK+ is concerned.  The "Hello World" program gives the general structure
of GTK+ development, which is maintained through out the following chapters.
The widget hierarchy is discussed as well as how to cast objects properly
ensuring correct pointer type to each particular function.  All the
signals and event handlers are discussed at a proper level of detail for
a beginning chapter.  If this were the only chapter, it would provide
any programmer with enough detail to begin exploring the API and begin
their own application.
<p>
Chapter 3 and 4 cover container widgets, which control layout and
decorations, which allow different effects on widgets, and basic
widgets (e.g. GtkToggleButton, GtkCheckButton, etc.).  These are
the basis for any good windowing toolkit and they are demonstrated
ablely and with confidence by an author who is clearly comfortable
with the toolkit and has no trouble articulating this to his reader.
<p>
Chapter 5 covers the different stock dialogs which come with GTK+, the
About dialog, Information dialogs, and the FileChooser dialog, etc.
While these are useful, building your own dialog boxes are left until
later chapters but this chapter does give the reader a feel for how to
use dialogs and where to place them in your program source for maximum
readability.
<p>
Chapter 6 is an odd chapter as it covers GLib and is not related directly
to GTK+ but it is necessary as some GTK+ functions return structures from
this library.  While it does give the reader a break from learning directly
about GTK+, it seems oddly placed however as it needed to go somewhere and
Chapter 6 is as good as any other chapter.  This chapter is the longest
chapter in the book and the author gives the reader a well deserved pat
on the back at the end.
<p>
Chapter 7 and 8 are devoted to the most complicated but useful widgets,
TextView and TreeView.  The TextView widget allows many different
operations for displaying text and the reader is introduced to many of
the functions that would allow one to write a word processor.  This
chapter is helped heavily by the fact that Krause is the developer
of an application that uses this widget heavily.  The use of the Pango
library and the facilities for fonts are also covered in this chapter.
In the next chapter, the reader is taken for a tour of the TreeView
widget which mostly consists of creating different renderers for the
different cells.  The reader is given useful advice about which to use
where and where to avoid using renderers which are called too often.
<p>
Chapter 9 describes how to build menus, toolbars, and popup menus both
manually and with the XML based mark-up language which comes with GTK+.
The reader is also introduced to the method for creating their own stock
icons for the tool bars and menu items.  This chapter basically completes
the core development needs of an application programmer and if the book
stopped here, it would be well worth purchasing.  The reader should now
be acquainted well enough with GTK+ to explore the API for needed
functions and structures themselves.  The XML demonstrated is a help as
much of the code for this section is a tad boring and repetitive and the
XML allows the reader to quickly create the required objects for the system.
<p>
Chapter 10 is another break from direct GTK+ development and the author
has a few points about user interface design before showing the reader
the Glade UI designer and libglade, which is necessary to use the
interface builder.  Much of a GTK+ application can be created from
Glade but, as Krause rightly cautions the reader, there is still much
development that needs to occur for the application to have the correct
behavior.  The XML created by Glade is similar to that used in the
previous chapter but it covers much of what a developer would need
in an application.  While some may have wished that Glade was introduced
earlier in the course of the book, Glade is an advanced topic and it
is beneficial for the reader to understand how to create applications
without Glade so that one could appreciate the design decisions when
developing with GTK+.
<p>
Chapter 11 shows the reader how to create custom widgets within the
toolkit from scratch which exposes in detail the inner workings of
GTK+.  Here Krause demonstrates using an IP input widget and a marquee
widget.  This chapter is quite long and involved and may take more
than one read but it is well worth the exercise to understand more
about the internals of the widgets that were introduced in earlier
chapters.
<p>
Chapter 12 is a miscellaneous chapter with some interesting widgets
that did not fit into the structure of the previous chapters including
the helpful GtkPrintOperation.  Chapter 13 gives you five applications
built with the facilities of the previous chapters and the code for
these can be obtained from the book's web site.  The appendices follow
and contain much information that is helpful when creating applications
with GTK+.
<p>
For the beginner, this book is an invaluable resource for learning about
GTK+.  The content is substantive and concise while maintaining
consistency throughout.  The consistency, especially in the code
sections, reinforces the information presented and code structure,
which helps the beginner keep good coding style when writing for GTK+.
The book remains tightly focused on presenting this sometimes daunting
amount of information, which is one of the other great qualities of
the book. For the expert, the table of contents, the appendices, and
the index are the most important aspects of the book.  These parts of
the book are amply treated so that it is easy to use the book as a
quick memory refresh.  Overall, this book is a solid and dependable
guide to a large windowing toolkit and should sit comfortably on any
GUI application developer's desk.
