<b>Overall:</b>
<p>
A well paced and structured book that covers the tasks, technologies
and theory required to create your own language parsers.
<p>
<b>Detailed:</b>
<p>
The book very cleverly and deliberately dovetails with the information
that is already in the public domain for ANTLR; it highlights the fact
that it is possible to produce a printed publication for a
predominantly "live" web based tool that is more than worth the cost
and effort to obtain it. There are numerous links back to the "live"
documentation on the tool's web site should the reader wish to delve
or involve themselves further with the topic being discussed. These do
not detract from the information in the book or serve as padding -
they point the reader to the best source of the information and work
to help the reader gain a better understanding of the subject.
<p>
The style of the writing is also at the right level; having read
through two revisions of the "Dragon" book and other very technical
language processing theory books at university I am well aware of just
how dry and academic the subject matter can be. This is avoided with a
clear focus on what you need to do without a full discussion of the
theory behind it. Those sections that deal with the theoretical
background of how ANTLR does what it does are carefully quarantined
in their own section and clearly indicated that they are quite
difficult. This structure means that anyone reading the book can
happily understand how to manipulate ANTLR to do what they need
without being put off with pages of very dry and complex algorithms.
<p>
Given that ANTLR can generate parsers in a wide range of languages
now, I would personally liked to have seen some of the
examples use them, perhaps C/C++. I am more at home with Python &
C/C++ than some of the Java examples used; offsetting that are the
facts that obviously Java is the author's chosen first language and
the consistency that having all of the examples in the same language
achieves.
<p>
The range of the topics covered is again well thought out and well
structured to lead the reader through the subject matter; a fact I
suppose you should expect as the author is now a professor and has
undoubtedly spent many an hour lecturing to undergraduates.
