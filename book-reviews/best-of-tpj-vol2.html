<p>

This is the 2nd in the 3 volumes of collected works from &quot;The Perl
Journal&quot; and deals with &quot;Perl programs that create things to look
at&quot;. Despite the editor having taken steps to weed out journal articles
which don't &quot;hold up well over age&quot;, the visual subject matter was
always going to suffer from feeling dated - especially 4 years after
publication of the book.

<p>

Part 1 (web content) feels really old due to the screen shots featured,
with earlier chapters dealing in timid CGI topics. The material does
however grow some teeth with coverage of mod_perl, HTML::Parser, HTML::Summary
and HTML::Mason.

<p>

Depending on your own experience, you may find too much of the web material
to be of too little use. However, what is provided is a decent spread of
toe-dipping material with something for everyone from beginners to those who
are in the process of tackling their first web-fronted perl-based solutions.

<p>

Part 2's coverage of graphics includes creating graphs with gnuplot (always
useful, but boils down to little more than orchestration of data and piping
gnuplot commamds to <code>gnuplot</code>) and GD-Graph3d (as featured in Report
Magic, the &quot;analog&quot; stats presentation tool).

<p>

Each charting chapter hand-holds the reader in getting simple charts up on screen,
without going into the myriad of display options available. This is adequate
taster material but it would have been nice to see reference to other
charting tools.

<p>

3D graphics was next up for some back-to-basics treatment, bolstered with
some OpenGL code samples and inards of a ray tracing program.

<p>

Most of the graphics chapters on offer here were little more than tasters,
including; writing Gimp plugins, using Glade to create Gtk-perl apps and
very basic Gnome panel applets.

<p>

However, the parting shot in this section gets its sleeves rolled up and
details the use of perl as the centrepiece of a real-time video capture
application. This was a refreshing departure from the preceding
material in that it was a hack solution to a problem space which was given
sufficient detail to hook the reader.

<p>

Part 3 closes the show with chapters treating widgets, events and callbacks
for Perl/Tk apps, throwing in a couple of basic example apps to tie it all
together.

<p>

<b>Summary</b>

<p>

Ok, this review turns up some 4 years after first publication of the book,
so it would be rich to call much of the content dated, but that is an
unavoidable assessment.

<p>

Combined with the &quot;scratch the surface&quot; nature of most of the
articles, its hard to see anything other than historical or sentimental
value in this volume of &quot;The Perl Journal&quot; articles.

<p>

Only Marc Lehmann's video capture article stands out for this reviewer, and
unless you habitually collect O'Reilly books or feel the need to complete
the 3 volume series, then I can't recommend this text.
