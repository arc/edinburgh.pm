<p>
This book is concise, readable, and useful. As it makes clear on the
cover, this is a reference book, and dives straight into very intense
details of the syntax of C++. It is meant as the kind of book you can
check when code that you thought should work isn't compiling, or when
you want to know the proper way to write something particular. In fact,
it reads quite like a plain-English version of the C++ standard itself.
<p>
It is perhaps surprising that the order of the chapters matches the
abstraction level of each topic; starting with the parsing of characters
in a source file, and working up through simple expressions to
functions, classes, and finally to the standard libraries provided to
assist you in common tasks. This may not be the order that the reader
becomes interested in the topics, but it reflects the nature of this
book as a reference rather than a cover-to-cover gripping read.
<p>
Even that first chapter contains treasures, such as the importance of
spaces in nested template declarations, where ">>" would be parsed
incorrectly. As well as statements of fact about the language, it
includes a few human touches like using words that most of us recognise
("source file", when the standard says "translation unit"), and even
advice not to use trigraphs; an obsolete part of the language which is
still valid. Later, it warns about the safety of iterators, which can
become almost as invalid as pointers, but doesn't spend long on
stylistic advice, a bit more of which might be welcome. It dwells more
on templates and containers, perhaps because they are less familiar to
many readers.
<p>
There are lots of short examples of code, particularly in explaining how
certain keywords are used and misused. There are cases where something
might look like a type or a function; cases where a complicated pointer
might be confusing about what it addresses, as well as more familiar
cases about the scope of variables that might hide others of the same
name. Again, these examples tend to be extremely short and to the point.
There are a number of other examples of complete programs, covering a
couple of pages, which have several classes with real functionality.
<p>
There are a decent number of cross references to other chapters, and
some of the same information is repeated in several places; for example
the "language reference" (chapter 12) lists every reserved word, with a
half page description of its purpose, and refers to related sections
that cover the topic in more detail. There were still occasions when it
took me longer to find the page I wanted, than I had hoped. Perhaps the
style of the index and referencing will become more familiar with use.
<p>
Seeing everything together, I was struck by how many innovative features
are in the language, and most of them good. While Perl, Python, Java and
the other languages we are familiar with have their own strengths
(consider, for example, how Perl goes out of its way to let you write
the same behaviour in many ways), and admitting that not everything in
C++ is good (some people don't use exceptions for fear of ambiguity over
resource ownership and clean-up), it was really inspiring to see what
C++ has: multiple inheritance, virtual functions, exceptions, templates,
dynamic casting, operator overloading, the standard library, namespaces,
and so on.
<p>
By far the largest part of the book is the standard library reference,
which is a good thing. The author is obviously pleased with this, and
devotes more than half of the pages to explaining each function.
Languages live or die by the capabilities (and elegance) of what comes
"in the box". Edinburgh University's ML was an interesting-ish thing to
study, but didn't help much when you wanted to interact with the real
world. PHP is a cute language for web designers who think they can
program, but its library is shockingly haphazard and incomplete. The C++
standard library is remarkable in its wealth of templates for storing
data. Containers, iterators, maps, vectors, and the various other
methods are covered with delight, encouraging you to get on with
programming your new algorithms, instead of reimplementing Donald
Knuth's. It also includes all of the C standard library, and various new
methods, too.
<p>
In summary, this book is a good volume to have on the shelf for those
occasions when your C++ compiler answers back about your syntax for
subtle language features, and good to have on your desk when you want to
use the standard library. Personally, I would have liked a bit more
advice about what is efficient, or what is risky. It is very clearly and
concisely written, which is a great benefit. Overall, a marked success.
