<p>
This is a terrific reminder of the breadth and skills needed when taking
on the role of CTO in a small company. The book really sticks to its
agenda, and goes through project management, quality assurance, process
improvement, assessment of what is already in place when you arrive,
recruitment and managerial politics.
<p>
It is easy to read, flowing at a good pace and with lists of key points,
some good diagrams, and entertaining half-page quotes from people who
have been in particular situations. There's an excellent diagram explaining
the misunderstandings that may arise in product features between customers,
engineers and marketing staff. The cost-benefit analysis of project tasks
being prioritised, and also the impact analysis of bug reports, are both
great. Since we'll always be asked to do more than we have time for, this
framework for justifying prioritisation will help other managers to
understand and express what matters.
<p>
Each chapter is long enough to give you an understanding of any topics you
may not already have known, but no single topic takes over the book. The
excellent references include Peopleware, The Mythical Man Month and User
Interface Design for Programmers, as well as Wikipedia and some recent
publications. Much of the book will be familiar to an experienced team
lead, but by going over each topic from the beginning, it gives you a
solid foundation in them all. As it says in the last chapter, "If you have
read straight through this book, you have covered a lot of ground."
<p>
The underlying principle of the book, in addressing a person newly hired
to be the CTO of a 50-person software company, is that you should first
review the position you're in. Consider business issues architecture,
quality, personalities and strategy as well as features. Then write some
notes before acting. This comes across repeatedly in talk of process
improvement, long term plans and quality time bombs, amongst many other
areas.
<p>
Although rich in truthiness, with many points I can confirm from my own
experience, there were a couple of small errors (which didn't detract
significantly). A list of factors motivating engineers is rather short 
(Fred Brookes has the proper list), a calculation of productive hours in a
day is done backwards, and a chart is described as having information that
it hasn't. Despite reading two chapters on product roadmaps, I found it was
still unclear how to match technical requirements to the market. Recruitment
is covered in depth (recommending day-long interviews) but it doesn't lead
on to the full costs of inducting new staff into a team.
<p>
Because the reader is likely to be highly familiar with their own technology,
but may be new to senior management politics, the book spends quite a lot of
time on soft skills. Some of this, like recruitment, may in fact already be
known, but some, like making sure that the engineering department remains
close to the marketing department, is very pertinent.
<p>
I wholeheartedly recommend Growing Software. I found it reassuring on those
topics already within my experience, and enlightening on the areas beyond.
It is never patronising, and has none of the padding that so many 400 page
books have. I look forward to more, both by the author and from this
publisher.
