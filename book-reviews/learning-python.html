<p>
A wood rat adorns the cover of Learning Python and it looks slightly scared,
I think the tagline may cause that fear. &quot;Object-Oriented Programming&quot;
it certainly scared me. Thankfully 'Learning Python' starts off gently with the
first few chapters introducing the language and telling you why it is a
great language to use and listing many examples of its use.
<p>
Sections two and three cover the basic objects, syntax and loops. Coming to
Python as a Perl hacker I found the syntax a bit strange at first but you soon
settle into it. It was nice to see documentation presented early, showing
you how to use Python's features to document your code and how to use that
documentation from inside an interactive session.
<p>
Functions and modules are well covered any by the time you finish those
sections you can be writing very functional Python scripts. However the main
meat of the book was the section on object oriented programming (OOP). It
started off with a general introduction to what OOP is and moved slowly
into how it is implemented. I was glad to see that it built on the
functions and modules previously covered, and really wasn't as scary as
I expected.
<p>
The final sections covered one of my favourite parts of Python, it's exception
handling. This was well presented and the way that Python lets you deal with
exceptions almost makes me want to use it in all my day to day scripts. It
finishes off with some good examples of common tasks, showing you built-in
functions and small code snippets to perform those tasks. Also included is
a good look at Python resources, covering; frameworks, IDEs and sources of
community information.
<p>
Overall I found the book to be an easy going read and each of the eight parts
finishes up with a good selection of excercises on the topics just covered.
There are solutions and small discussions on these exercises in appendix B.
<p>
My only concern about this version of the book would be it's age, this is the
second edition and was published in December 2003. While it covers version 2.3
it mentions that this was the upcoming release. As the current version is 2.5.1
I worried that some new important features may be missed out, however I can
see that the third edition is just about to be released which I'm sure would
address these worries. There is also a large list of errata, mostly typos, but
there are a few mistakes in the code examples.

<p>

<b>Summary</b>

<p>

I found this book a great introduction to Python and would reccomend it to
anyone looking to learn the language. An updated copy that covers the latest
versions of Python would be good but I can see this is on the horizon.
